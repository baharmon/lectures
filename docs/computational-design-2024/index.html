<aside class="notes">
Hello. 
I am Brendan Harmon,
an assistant professor of landscape architecture
at Louisiana State University.
Today I will be talking about
my recent research and teaching.
While I have expertise in the spatial sciences,
recently I have been focused on computational design
- on the creative use of computation in the design process.
Computational design is design with data,
with algorithms and simulations.
This talk will explore several applications
of computational design -
heritage preservation,
point cloud modeling,
computational ecology,
and ecological robotics.

<aside class="notes">
With funding from the National Park Service,
my colleague Nick Serrano and I
scanned Rosedown Plantation
in St. Francisville, Louisiana.
Rosedown is unique for its extant, largely intact plantation gardens;
these gardens are important
not only for being representative of 
plantation garden design in the American South,
but also as artifacts of enslaved labor.

such as the flowers in bloom on the rockery
- pictured here -
and the spanish moss swaying
on the live oak allee.

<h1 id="african-american-burial-grounds">African American Burial Grounds</h1>



<aside class="notes">
With an interdisciplinary team of colleagues,
I have begun a long term project
to preserve a record of the burial grounds
of enslaved African Americans and their descendants.
In the American South, 
These sites have long faced precarious conditions; 
originally built peripheral to antebellum plantations, 
today many occupy remnant parcels of isolated land. 
Climate change, 
industrial expansion, 
precarious land-tenure records, 
and dwindling populations of descendant communities 
threaten these cultural landscapes. 
The aim of this project 
is to develop a methodology for documenting 
the history, material culture, 
ecological character, and soundscapes 
of these neglected heritage sites. 
Here is a point cloud of Alford Cemetery
captured by a drone with a lidar module.
With drone lidar,
we can record these landscapes and their surroundings
at centimeter resolution.

<aside class="notes">
I am also interested in point clouds
as a new design medium for landscape architecture,
that is both hyper-detailed, yet also abstract.

<h1 id="point-cloud-modeling">Point Cloud Modeling</h1>



<aside class="notes">
I have been experimenting with
point cloud modeling techniques.
Complex, detailed scenes can be composited
by segmenting, transforming, and merging point clouds. 
Features can be classified and segmented
either manually or automatically
with algorithms and machine learning techniques.
Segmented point clouds can be transformed manually 
or algorithmically with, for example, Grasshopper.
Here is a simple example of 
randomly scattered laser scanned plants.

With regular aerial surveys 
I can map fluxes of aboveground biomass and carbon
in the meadow. 
Here, for example, is the 
the net annual biomass of the meadow
in its first year. 
By accounting for carbon storage in meadows and prairies,
we can demonstrate their ecoystem services
and advocate for their creation or conservation.

<h1 id="atlas-of-heritage-trees">Atlas of Heritage Trees</h1>



<aside class="notes">
For another project - the Atlas of Heritage Trees -
I am laser scanning ancient trees 
of significant historical, cultural, and ecological importance.
Louisiana has many large, old, and culturally significant specimens
of southern live oak and bald cypress. 
These trees are charismatic megaflora – 
specimens that capture the imagination of the public 
and encourage broader support for biodiversity conservation.
To preserve a record of these irreplaceable cultural icons, 
we are compiling an Atlas of Heritage Trees.
As a digital humanities project,
this research aims to document and share
the legacy of these heritage trees.
As a work of computational ecology,
this research aims to estimate the 
biomass and carbon of large, old trees
which act as keystone ecological structures.

<aside class="notes">
As part of this project,
I have developed a method for building volumetric models
from laser scanned point clouds. 
This volumetric modeling process can be used to 
calculate the volume of large, old trees
with extensive cavities
for biomass and carbon estimation. 
It can also be used to 3D print models of these specimens
for outreach, education, and exhibition.
