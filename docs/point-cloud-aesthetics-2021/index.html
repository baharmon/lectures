<p><strong>Point Clouds</strong>
are algorithmically mediated, indexical encodings
of space and color at an instance in time



<aside class="notes">
A point cloud is an index; it is a trace of its subject, a record of light as a space. It can also be iconic, an immediately legible rendering of a scene. As the result of an algorithm encoded as numeric data, the point cloud is also a collection of symbols. It is contingent on framing and chance. The indexical, iconic, symbolic, and contingent nature of the point cloud give it meaning – connecting it to the scene, author, and algorithms. They are the foundation for aesthetic expression in this emerging medium.

<h1 id="indexicality">Indexicality</h1>
<p><strong>Indices</strong> are physically and causally connected to what they represent



<aside class="notes">
In Peirce's semiotics an index is a sign that is physically or causally connected to what it represents. As its physical imprint, a footprint is an index for a foot. Smoke is an index for a fire; if you see smoke, then you know that it has been caused by a fire. A photograph, as a record of light captured on photographic film or a digital image sensor, is an index that is both physically and causally connected by rays of light to the scene that it represents. Point clouds, like photographs, are indexical because they are physically and causally connected by pulses of light to what they represent.

<h1 id="iconicity">Iconicity</h1>
<p><strong>Icons</strong> look like what they represent



<aside class="notes">
Point clouds are iconic because they look like what they represent. Their iconic nature is unique because of their fidelity, inherent three dimensionality, and resulting immersivity. Their indexical link to the scene captured imbues them with a authenticity that grounds their iconic claim to faithfully represent reality.

<aside class="notes">
Point clouds' indexicality, their truth claim, seems so authoritative as to be hyperreal, displacing reality – they are used as definitive records, as evidence, as substitutes for things lost, and to fabricate replicas. What does it mean to "step into an overwhelmingly convincing simulacrum of physical reality, space and time?" (Girot) Will hyperreal simulacra really enhance landscape architects' "understanding of site, and yield a stronger awareness of ambient aspects and cues?" (Girot) Or will these simulacra usher in an aesthetic crisis of creativity, an "end of the imaginary" (Baudrillard 1994)?

<aside class="notes">
Point clouds, however, are imperfect icons with noise, systematic errors, occlusions in capture, and voids. By their very nature as a collection of points in space, there is empty space between each point, a discontinuity that does not exist in reality. Their incompleteness makes point clouds a fundamentally abstract medium, countering their hyperrealism. There is rich aesthetic tension between the point cloud’s hyperreal detail and depth and the painterly abstraction with which it is rendered.

<h1 id="symbolism">Symbolism</h1>
<p><strong>Symbols</strong> are given meaning by convention



<aside class="notes">
Symbols are signs given meaning only by conventional standards. While the scene captured in a point cloud may have symbolic significance, point clouds themselves are inherently symbolic since they have been encoded as digital data. Scanned point clouds are transformed from light into waves of electrons, processed by algorithms, and stored as symbolic data structures.

<h2 id="algorithmic-mediation">Algorithmic Mediation</h2>
<!-- Diagram of perceptual and conceptual indices -->



<aside class="notes">
The transcription of photons into bits algorithmically mediates meaning. The point cloud remains a pure perceptual index of the referent, while as a conceptual index it becomes symbolically mediated by algorithms. The conceptual index - the trace of ideas – becomes a mark not only of the scene, but also of the author and the algorithms. A mark to be decoded and interpreted.

<h1 id="contingency">Contingency</h1>
<p>The <strong>contingent</strong> is subject to change and chance



<aside class="notes">
In its uncertainty, the contingent connotes the freedom of possibility and thus the potential for creativity. When laser pulses trace the contours of a scene, what is captured is contingent upon atmospheric conditions, the play of the light and shadow, gusts of wind, the fall of rain, and chance passersby.

<aside class="notes">
The indexical, iconic, and symbolic contingency of point clouds is generative, forming a creative space between author, algorithm, and environment. The generative potential of point clouds as a medium lies in creatively transgressing the constraints of the technology, for it is the algorithmic nature and limits of the medium that create room for meaning.

## Analytic Exploration
### [Staircase](https://xyz.cct.lsu.edu/data/rosedown/interior.html)



<aside class="notes">
A transect through the point cloud reveals indexical detail – close examination of the slave staircase reveals the imprint of enslaved footsteps, worn in the wood, an index of their presence and toil. Despite the erasure of the enslaved people’s quarters and community, the point cloud still reveals marks of their presence and evokes their labor.

<aside class="notes">
The point cloud of Rosedown captures the complexity and temporality of landscape in the convoluted branching structure of live oaks, drapery of Spanish moss, seasonality of flowers, texture of bark, and a profusion of leaves. With its overwhelming detail and noticeable occlusions, this point cloud highlights a relationship between the noisy and imperfect, but rigidly structured formal gardens and the natural logic of irregular plants, all abstracted in a pointillist style that coheres noisy details into an impressionistic rendering of light. These details begin to show the landscape’s dynamic character, its semiotic richness beyond its tectonic form and symbolism.

A time series of point clouds can be collected by repeatedly surveying a site with lidar or photogrammetry. Change over time can be represented visually through a sequence of iconic, yet analytic point cloud renderings such as transects, each representing a discrete event in time.

Time series of point clouds can also be numerically analyzed to study spatiotemporal phenomena. Analyses can be rendered as three-dimensional scatter plots, another type of point cloud.

<aside class="notes">
These scatterplots are purely conceptual indices whose perceptual links to the landscape have disappeared. Despite their intensive algorithmic processing, they still retain indexical links to the landscape as data that record traces of its processes. They represent a trace of an idea such as fluxes of carbon, rather than the look and physical structure of the landscape. By modeling scatter plots as point clouds, abstract data visualizations can be combined with reductive, yet iconic graphics to form a composition in a single medium.
