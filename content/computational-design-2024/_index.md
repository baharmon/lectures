{{< note >}}
Hello. 
I am Brendan Harmon,
an assistant professor of landscape architecture
at Louisiana State University.
Today I will be talking about
my recent research and teaching.
My current research programs include
heritage preservation,
computational ecology,
and ecological robotics.

# Heritage Preservation

{{< note >}}
My research in heritage preservation 
uses emerging technologies such as lidar
to preserve a record of disappearing heritage landscapes.
Today, I will present a project to document
African American burial grounds. 
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
I use technologies including 
terrestrial laser scanning 
and drones with lidar
to record the spatial structure
and phenomenological character
of heritage landscapes.

# African American Burial Grounds

{{< note >}}
With colleagues
in the LSU School of Architecture
and the Department of Landscape Architecture
at the University of Florida,
I have begun a long term project
to preserve a record of the burial grounds
of enslaved African Americans and their descendants.
In the American South, 
These sites have long faced precarious conditions; 
originally built peripheral to antebellum plantations, 
today many occupy remnant parcels of isolated land. 
Climate change, 
industrial expansion, 
precarious land-tenure records, 
and dwindling populations of descendant communities 
threaten these cultural landscapes. 
The aim of this project 
is to develop a methodology for documenting 
the history, material culture, ecological character, and soundscapes 
of these neglected heritage sites. 
With drone lidar,
we can record these landscapes
at centimeter resolution.

{{< note >}}
With terrestrial laser scanning,
we can record gravesites in immersive detail. 
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="alford-3.jpg" >}}

{{< note >}}
We are also experimenting with new scanning techniques such as 
neural radiance fields.

# Computational Ecology

{{< note >}}
My research in computational ecology
explores the use of lidar
to estimate biomass and carbon. 
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="hilltop-1.jpg" >}}

# Drone Data Analytics

{{< note >}}
Since 2020 I have been using drones
with lidar and multispectral sensors
to study the evolution of the meadow
established at Hilltop Arboretum.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="hilltop-6.png" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
With regular aerial surveys 
I can map fluxes of aboveground biomass and carbon
in the meadow. 
Here, for example, is the 
the net annual biomass of the meadow
in its first year.

# Atlas of Heritage Trees

{{< note >}}
For another project - the Atlas of Heritage Trees -
I am laser scanning ancient trees 
of significant historical, cultural, and ecological importance.
As a digital humanities project,
this research aims to document and share
the legacy of these heritage trees.
As a work of computational ecology,
this research aims to estimate the 
biomass and carbon of large, old trees. 
{{< /note >}}

<img src="big-cypress-dendro.jpg" width="400">

{{< note >}}
As part of this project,
I have developed a method for building volumetric models
from laser scanned point clouds. 
This volumetric modeling process can be used to 
calculate the volume of large, old trees
with extensive cavities
for biomass and carbon estimation. 
It can also be used to 3D print models of these specimens
for outreach and exhibition.

Here, for example, is a 3D print of the Big Cypress,
a 1500 year old Bald Cypress on Cat Island in Louisiana.

# Robotics

{{< note >}}
I am also exploring creative applications for robots.
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="ecological-robotics-7.jpg" >}}

# Ecological Robotics

{{< note >}}
I have been developing methods for
robotic planting in the lab and the field.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="ecological-robotics-2.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
In the lab I developed a process for 3D printing with seeds.
I use a robotic system to extrude seeds in a paste
of clay, planting media, and water.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="ecological-robotics-3.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
With robotic paste-based extrusion,
seeds can be precisely planted
in computationally generated patterns.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="ecological-robotics-4.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
To scale up, I will deploy this
planting system on a field robot.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="ecological-robotics-5.jpg" >}}

{{< note >}}
With robotic planting,
we can computationally design
and autonomously plant
ecological gradients.
Here, for example, is a 
gradient of procedural noise.
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="ecological-robotics-6.jpg" >}}

{{< note >}}
And here are seedlings 
in a prodecural noise gradient.

# Studio

## Giant Panda National Park

LA 7051 Advanced Topics Studio, Fall 2019

{{< note >}}
In my upper level studios, 
students have an opportunity
to apply creative computational thinking
to planning and design projects.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="panda-park-1.jpg" >}}

{{< note >}}
In a studio on computational ecology, for example,
students designed a masterplan
for giant panda conservation
in Sichuan, China.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="panda-park-2.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
After fieldwork in the mountains, 
they used ecological models to simulate a network 
of ecologically functional corridors for giant pandas
that accounted for sensory ecology and stochastic variation.
{{< /note >}}

---

{{< slide background-image="panda-park-3.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
Then they used Grasshopper to rapidy design 
ecologically diverse reforestion schemes
for the habitat corridors.

# Thesis

## [The Siltcatcher](https://doi.org/10.31390/gradschool_theses.5135)

### [A Sediment-Capture System for Wetland Creation and Coastal Protection in Western Lake Pontchartrain](https://doi.org/10.31390/gradschool_theses.5135)

Andrew Wright, 2020

{{< note >}}
I also regularly teach research methods
and advise capstone and theses.
Here is an example of a thesis I advised
that uses simulation for speculative design. 
This thesis - the Siltcatcher - 
envisioned a system of offshore structures
for accumulating sediment from the Bonnet Carr√© Spillway
to catalyze the development of new wetlands.
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="siltcatcher-1.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
The student used a physical hydrodynamic model
to test and evaluate design ideas.
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="siltcatcher-2.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
He used simulations with tracer dye
to study the flow and acculumation of fine sediment...
{{< /note >}}

{{< slide background-image="siltcatcher-3.jpg" background-size="contain" >}}

{{< note >}}
and develop a design
that would catalyze land building
in Lake Pontchartrain.
